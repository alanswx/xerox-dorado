# Complete FPGA snapshots: RAM access prototype

Complete machine save/restore is required milestone4a in
[the delivery plan](../../../docs/verilog-clock-plan.md). It is not implemented
in the running MiSTer core. This directory qualifies one bounded RAM-bank
access method before extending it to the actual board hierarchy.

`f10415_bank.sv` models an IM-like1024x34 bank from34 original F10415A slices.
It exports1024 RAM words plus a separate34-bit read-pipeline word. The RAM
read always clocks. During scanning, a saved register supplies the guest's
previous read output. On resume, the first ordinary edge performs the normal
read/write; no guest warm-up edge is inserted. The caller must hold every
other guest clock/state at the same boundary. That system barrier is not
provided by this prototype. Do not wire this into production as a complete
pause implementation.

The requester asserts `freeze` after holding guest state, waits for `frozen`,
then issues requests. Each accepted request produces `done` and its read data
after one clock; write-response data is unspecified. Word0..1023 accesses RAM,
word1024 accesses the saved pipeline, and every larger11-bit index returns
`error` without writing. Requests during entry or resume are not accepted.
Transfers use complete34-bit words, keeping write enables shared so Quartus
can pack the slices. A future byte/DDR serializer must assemble a complete
word before committing it. This is a local bank interface, not a snapshot
file format or the final host protocol.

Run `python3 fpga/mister/snapshot/test_f10415.py --mutations` on the Mac.
The test uses34 unchanged original cells with a separately controlled reference
clock, plus an independent array oracle. It checks every exported/restored
bit, a saved read output deliberately different from its current RAM word,
every invalid index, destructive continuation and first-edge resume, and
30000 random running steps. Four broken variants must fail: lost pipeline,
scan output leakage, running access and invalid-address aliasing.

`fit_f10415.py --output NEW_DIRECTORY` runs isolated matched projects on
misterubuntu with Quartus17.0.2, the MiSTer5CSEBA6U23I7 device,50MHz and
virtual data pins with2ns input/output budgets. It does not program a board.
`audit_f10415.py DIRECTORY` checks source hashes, memory geometry/packing,
OLD_DATA mixed-port collision configuration, all four operating conditions
and unconstrained-path reports. Recovery/removal have no applicable paths
in this synchronous bank.

The qualified whole-word fit retains34816 RAM bits/fourM10Ks in both variants.
Baseline101 ALMs becomes163, with43 additional registers. All12 setup/hold/
pulse-width checks per variant pass across four conditions; snapshot minimum
slack is+0.096ns. These are isolated virtual-I/O measurements, not a full-board
resource or timing budget. Two rejected experiments show why inference must
be checked: separate conditional write addresses expanded the bank into
logic, and independent per-bit restore enables used34 M10Ks. The production
original cell is unchanged; the prototype additionally requests defined
old-data collision behavior instead of its `no_rw_check` attribute.

Next: prove grouping/access on an actual board with its real strobes and
clock-history registers, then extend the inventory and barrier to external
SDRAM, all devices, input and ARM disk/local network-server state. A complete
bundle must pair a matching disk generation, validate schema/build/hashes
before changing live state, and pass actual Cedar desktop restore tests.
No physical snapshot, fast-boot timing or cross-build compatibility is claimed.
